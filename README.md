# -suspicious_processORservices-
show all Processes and Services in computers in our network. 
my aim is to identify whether there is suspicious process that will indicate to us on network attack

all data show with the python laibry tkinter, gui.
After each minute we accept a table, a matrix.
data will show us the processes and services in addition to any computer on the network, in addition to those who got (that were tested earlier and now are).
During the attack, we can check the information received, comparing the time mark-attack with the information at the same time.
and with that, we can see if there are processes that have been added / dropped might be related to the attack.
